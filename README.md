## üéØ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **personal portfolio webpage** as part of the **Responsive Web Design Certification** on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

> üí° Inspired by:  
[Portfolio Page Demo](https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks)  
‚ö†Ô∏è *Do not copy the demo project.*

## üñºÔ∏è Project Context

This project will eventually become my true portfolio, so I went beyond the certification's requirements. I used esthetic inspiration from a videogame that I find particulary appealing,
Hotline Miami.

The true goal is to build an appealing portfolio that showcases my abilities.
To this end, I tried to make a strong first impression with a Welcome Page making use of a marking background, all done using CSS.
